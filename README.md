## OASIS INFOBYTE TASK 1
# BMI CALCULATOR

## Overview of the project

I was required to complete atleast 3 tasks out of the given tasks to complete my internship in the domain of Python Programming from Oasis Infobyte. For my 1st task, I chose to develop a simple BMI calculator app.

## Objectives of the project  

- Make a simple, command-line BMI calculator
- Prompt the users for their weight in kg and height in m
- Display the BMI result to the user
- Display the weight category depending on the calculated BMI value to the user

## Implementation of the project

The implementation of this project was very simple.  
- I took the user inputs of height and weight as float values.
- Using the pow function, I calculated the BMI according to the formula.
- I checked the BMI value for its predefined ranges using if-elif-else statements to determine the category of the weight of the user.
- I also used the round function to display the BMI upto 2 decimal places.
